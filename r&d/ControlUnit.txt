
by definition the following effect table is only true on positive clock edges since they are writes

Effect Table:
    RegWrite:
        effect when deasserted:
            None
        effect when asserted:
            The register on the Write register input is written with the value on the Write data input
    ALUSrc:
        effect when deasserted:
            The second ALU operand comes from the second register file output (Read Data 2)
        effect when asserted:
            The second ALU operand is the sign-extended 12 bits of the instruction(immgen)
    PCSrc:
        effect when deasserted:

        effect when asserted:

    MemRead:
        effect when deasserted:
            None
        effect when asserted:

    MemWrite:
        effect when deasserted:
            None
        effect when asserted:

    MemtoReg:
        effect when deasserted:

        effect when asserted:
