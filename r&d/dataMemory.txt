Inputs:
    - Address (ALU Output)
    - Write Data (regOut2)
    - MemWrite - When do I write
    - MemRead - When do I read
    - clock - for sync

Output:
    - Read Data 

According to page 250 of CompOrgandDesign (RiscV), a data race occurs between two threads at the same spot in memory if at least one is a write and they occur one after another

When writing you need to make sure the address and data are stable, for this writes can only happen on posedge
