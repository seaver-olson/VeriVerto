Instruction Types :
    R-Type: reg + reg = reg
    I-Type: reg + immediate = reg
    S-Type: reg = memory (address = reg address + immediate offset)
    B-Type: branch offset (PC + immediate offset)
    U-Type: build large constant (20 bits shifted)
    J-Type: jump offset (PC + immediate)


DataPath LifeCycle:
    Control Unit looks at opcode to decide the type of Instruction
