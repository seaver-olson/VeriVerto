Every RISCV Instruction is 32bits(1 word)

inputs: instruction 32 bits 
output: immgenOut 32 bits

opcode, funct3 and funct7 will all be in the same spots for each instruction type

The first register operand is always in bit positions 19:15(rs1) for R-Type instructions and branch instructions
    - This field also specifies the base register for load and store instructions

The second register operand is always in bit positions 24:20(rs2) for R-Type instructions and branch instructions.
    - This field also specifies the register operand that gets copied to memory for store instructions.

Another operand can also be 12-bit offset for branch or load-store instructions

The dest reg is always in bit positions 11:7 (rd) for R-type instructions and load instructions

R-Type:
    Register to Register (no immediate)
    Example: add, sub, and, or, xor, sll, srl, slt, sra, sltu

    Instruction[6:0]   = opcode   (7 bits)
    Instruction[11:7]  = rd       (5 bits) - destination register (0-31, 2^5 = 32)
    Instruction[14:12] = funct3   (3 bits) - function code (helps specify operation)
    Instruction[19:15] = rs1      (5 bits) - source register 1
    Instruction[24:20] = rs2      (5 bits) - source register 2
    Instruction[31:25] = funct7   (7 bits) - function code (distinguishes add/sub, etc.)

I-Type:
    Instruction[6:0]   = opcode   (7 bits)
    Instruction[11:7]  = rd       (5 bits) - destination register
    Instruction[14:12] = funct3   (3 bits) - function code
    Instruction[19:15] = rs1      (5 bits) - source register 1
    Instruction[31:20] = imm[11:0] (12 bits) - immediate value (sign-extended to 32 bits)

S-Type:
    Instruction[6:0]   = opcode     (7 bits)
    Instruction[11:7]  = imm[4:0]   (5 bits) - immediate lower bits
    Instruction[14:12] = funct3     (3 bits) - function code
    Instruction[19:15] = rs1        (5 bits) - base address register
    Instruction[24:20] = rs2        (5 bits) - source register (data to store)
    Instruction[31:25] = imm[11:5]  (7 bits) - immediate upper bits
